- **State Management**: React Context API (ThemeProvider)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation (Stack + Tab Navigation)
- **API**: OpenAI GPT-4 and GPT-4o-mini (for summarization)
- **Local Storage**: SQLite (expo-sqlite)
- **Push Notifications**: Expo Notifications (planned)
- **Deployment**: TestFlight (iOS only)
